This all needs to be performed in a python virtualenv:

In an Ubuntu you can create one by using:

	$ virtualenv .game

and activate it via:

	$ source .game/bin/activate

now install sphinx in it via
	
	$ pip install sphinx

To compile the Documentation use

	$ make clean html                # Make the docs in HTML
	$ firefox _build/html/index.html # View it in a firefox browser
  
	$ make clean latexpdf               # Make the docs in Latex PDF
	$ evince _build/latexpdf/sample.pdf # View it in a firefox browser
  
There are more formats available. So check out what you need.

To configure the template use the conf.py file and enter your details
there. It should be straight forward.

Always look at the WARNINGS the compiling gives you. They are
really helpfull.
